Goal
====

Provide a way for us to interact with our world : 
- percieve it
- represent it
- understand it
- simulate it
- safely modify it


---

The Universe
============

- Space : 3 perceived dimensions, usually projected as 2 for representation
- Time : 1 perceived dimensions with linear order, usually represented as 1 line with a direction
- Physics attempts to perceive and represent it accuratelly, and eventually act on it to modify it.
- Mathematics attempts to develop tools to understand and predict it. 
- We will deal with the multiverse later...

---

Life
====

- Space : life can percieve it, and act on it by duplicating itself, or sometimes displacing itself in it.
- Time : life developed ways to percieve it and acting on it (memory, planning, etc.).
- At a small scale, life can start and stop, and even change/mutate. 
- Biology attempts to percieve and represent it accurately, and eventually act on it to modify it.
- We will deal with sentient beings (who can conscioulsy influence their own life) later.

---

Semantics
=========

- Intent : What we mean when we represent something
- Operational : The mental/actual process followed to interpret the representation
- Our semantics should be intuitive for humans, so what is usually implicit/explicit should remain implicit/explicit in the representation.
- Our semantics should be as simple as possible, and familiar for humans.

---

Arithmetics
===========

- Completeness/Incompleteness Theorems : We should be aware of results in arithemtics that are relevant for computer science.
- Our Semantics and Representation will likely be isomorphic to some arithemtic, and we need to investigate the properties of such an arithmetic.
